Questions from Chapter 2

1. A Simple Graph is which multiple edges and loops are not allowed. In such a graph, the edges form a set and each edge is an unordered pair of distinct veritices. In a simple graph with n vertices, the degree of every vertex is at most n-1. 

2. A complete graph is where every vertice is joined by an edge. A complete graph contains all possible edges. A Regular graph is a graph in which each vertex has the same number of neighbors. In such a graph, every vertex has the same degree. A regular graph with vertices of degree k is called a k-regular graph or regular graph of degree k. 

3. A Path is a finite or infinite sequence of edges which connect a distinct sequence of vertices. A cycle in a graph can be characterized by a closed walk or a simple cycle. A closed graph is a sequence of vertices starting and ending at the same vertices, with each two consecutive vertices adjecent to each other in the graph. A simple cycle has two definitions. It can be either a closed walk with no repetitions of vertices and edges allowed, other than the starting and ending vertex. It can also be defined as simply the set of edges in such a walk. 

4. A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. An acyclic connected graph is a tree. A Forest is a disjoint union of trees.
